# Chain #

Chain is a tool to help keep track of tasks that need to be completed
regularly. The idea is that one can improve motivation to complete
important tasks by seeing them as being like a "chain", where the
admonition is to not "break the chain" by skipping the task on any given
day.

While this is anecdotally attributed to comedian Jerry Seinfield as a
way to achieve greater success in creative endeavours, it applies
equally well to any kind of task.
